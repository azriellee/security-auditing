# Audit 3: CodeHawks Weather Witness

## Audit Experience

I did not take part in this contest as I went on a 1 month trip to Japan xp. After coming back I decided to look through this contest and do a quick writeup rather than an entire audit report just as a refresher. Nevertheless, I learnt a lot during this audit about how oracles work, in particular Chainlink Functions and Chainlink Automation. This part took me quite a while to understand, especially since I have rarely used oracles before and have never audited a project that used oracles.

Please refer to the findings.md file for the vulnerabilities I caught and moreso for the ones that I missed out on.
