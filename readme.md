# Security Auditing Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my collection of security audit reports submitted for blockchain security contests and capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. This repository serves as a portfolio of my research, analysis, and findings from real-world smart contract auditing competitions.

This repo holds all the reports for actual security auditing contests that I have taken part in and the results of the contests. Each folder would contain a `readme.md` file which is a summary of the findings for the particular contest, and the results of it when released.

## About Me

I'm a soon to be graduate in Computer Science and I've been learning about the Smart Contract Security and Security Auditing for a little less than a month. I have always found blockchain, Web3 and DeFi technology really interesting and I'm glad that I discovered the world of Smart Contract Development and Auditing. I started off doing Ethernaut challenges first, before moving to Damn Vulnerable Defi. Now with my improved knowledge and skills I will be transitioning to doing more Competitve Security Audits

This repo represents my journey and growth through practical contests. I can't wait for the day that I look through this repo and realise how much I've grown in this space.
